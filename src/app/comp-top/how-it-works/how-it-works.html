    TradersBit is a marketplace for streams of Bitcoin trading signals.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    Publishers create streams, send trading signals to streams, and sell subscriptions to streams. Publishing on TradersBit is
    completely free. Signals can be published through our website, API or by connecting your Bitfinex account. The API makes it possible
    to connect trading bots and other applications.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    Statistics for each stream's performance are computed and displayed in the marketplace. Trading fees are incorporated in
    the statistics.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    Subscribers can browse, filter and sort streams based on average monthly profit, average trade, and other indicators. When
    subscribing to a stream, users can receive signals via email or have the signaled trades automatically executed through
    their own Bitfinex accounts.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    The publishers of the streams will set the monthly subscription fee. Upon selling subscriptions, publishers will earn 70
    percent of the subscription fees. We get the remaining 30 percent. TradersBit earns profits only when the publishers
    make profits, so our respective interests are the same.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    Upon the reception of a trading signal, we simulate the trade (including trading fees). As a result of this, there is no
    way for the publishers to manipulate statistics.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    There is no social interaction in this marketplace because the statistics and trading signals speak for themselves. This
    way, subscribers will not be scammed easily. A subscriber should not need to know or care whether signals are sent manually
    by a teenager, an MBA graduate or automatically generated by a trading bot. At TradersBit, the streams and statistics
    matter, not the people behind them.
  </p>
  <p class="md-body-1">
    TradersBit will also host trading competitions. For instance, most profitable streams last 30 days, etc., with rewards in
    Bitcoins.
