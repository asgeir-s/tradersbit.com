              This is a marketplace for streams of bitcoin trading signals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Publishers can create streams, send trading signals to streams and sell subscriptions to streams. Statistics for each streams
              performance is computed and displayed in the marketplace. All closed trades are displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subscribers can browse and sort streams based on average monthly profit, average trade profit and many other indicators.
              When subscribing to a stream, the subscriber can get signals sent to his email or automatically executed on
              his behalf with our autotrader-feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              The publisher decides the subscription fee (monthly fee) and when a subscription is sold, <b>the publisher immediately receives
                    70% of the subscription fee</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              All statistics are created from live "simulated" trading of each signal in the stream. This way there is now way for the
              publishers to manipulate statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no social interaction on this marketplace, because the statistics and trading signals speak for them self. This
              way subscribers will not be easily scammed. A subscriber should not know or care whether signals are sent manually
              by a kid, an MBA graduate or automatically generated by a trading boot (algorithm trading).
            </p>
            <p>
              Signals can be published through our website, mobile app or API.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our API makes it possible to write trading systems in any programming language and easily integrate it with existing trading
              systems (bots).
            </p>
            <p>TradersBit will also host trading competitions, for instace most profitable stream last 30 days etc. Where all
              rewards are in Bitcoin.</p>

                    Signals you can send are SHORT, LONG and CLOSE. A SHORT or LONG signal is always followed by a close signal. If you go directly
                    from SHORT to LONG or LONG to SHORT a CLOSE signal is automaticly generated for you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you send a LONG signal you will make a profit if the price of Bitcoin goes up. You profit if the price of bitcoin is higher
                    when you CLOSE your trade, then it was when you sent the LONG signal.

                  <p>
                    If you send a SHORT signal, you will make a profit if the price of Bitcoin goes down. You profit if the price of bitcoin
                    is lower when you CLOSE your trade, then it was when you sent the SHORT signal.

                    A CLOSE signal closes your current position.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each signal will simulate using all assets avalible.
