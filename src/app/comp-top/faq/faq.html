        <h4>How does Autotrader work?</h4>
        <p>
          Autotrader will trade the stream's incoming signals, on the subscriber's behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, autotrader only does margin trading. Therefore, the money you want autotrader to trade with must be in your "Trading
          Wallet" at Bitfinex.
        </p>
        <p>
          All trades executed by Autotrader are market orders. A market order is a buy or a sell order to be executed immediately at
          current market prices. This means that you should not expect to get the exact same price as recorded in the trading
          signal, because of slippage, latency, etc. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp"
            target="_blank">Read about slippage on Investopedia.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the first signal, autotrader will close any open BTC/USD margin position before executing the signaled order. When executing
          an order, the amount autotrader will use to buy or sell short is your specified "Percentage to Trade" of "Tradable
          Balance" in your "Trading Wallet". If you specified 100% "Percentage to Trade", it will use 99.9%, this is done
          to make sure you have the funds to cover the order at the order time.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an average latency of approximately 2 seconds from a signal is published by the publisher, until the order is executed
          at the exchange. Therefore, this should not be thought of as a high-frequency trading solution.

        <h4>How do TradersBit simulate trades?</h4>
        <p>
          When simulating trades (LONG, SHORT, CLOSE), we use the last price and 0.02% fee (takers fee). Each signal will simulate
          a trade using all assets available.

        <h4>What does LONG, SHORT and CLOSE mean?</h4>
        <p>
          SHORT, LONG, and CLOSE are the signalks you can send to your streams. A SHORT or LONG signal is always followed by a CLOSE
          signal. If you go directly from SHORT to LONG or LONG to SHORT, a CLOSE signal is automatically generated for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you send a LONG signal, you will make a profit if the price of the Bitcoin goes up. You profit if the price of the Bitcoin
          is higher when you CLOSE your trade than it was when you sent the LONG signal. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp"
            target="_blank">Read about LONGING on Investopedia.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you send a SHORT signal, you will make a profit if the price of the Bitcoin goes down. You profit if the price of the
          Bitcoin is lower when you CLOSE your trade than it was when you sent the SHORT signal. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp"

        </p>
        <p>
          A CLOSE signal closes your current position.

        <h4>How will TradersBit make money?</h4>
        <p>
          TradersBit gets 30% of the subscription fee when subscribers buy subscriptions to streams. The publisher of the stream gets
          70%. We make money if the publisher makes money.

        <h4>What does BETA mean?</h4>
        <p>
          TradersBit is currently in BETA. By this, we mean we are in the early stages, under heavy development and TradersBit not
          thoroughly tested yet. Therefore, there might be unforeseen events like parts of the service might not work as
          intended, there might be downtime, and there are not all essential features are implemented yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should not have any impact on who wins the competition because all users should have the same experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We released in BETA because we wanted to release a version as fast as possible to let publisher start building statistics.

          For now, each user can have three streams each.

        <p>
          There should be one account per user. Users with multiple accounts might be banned and disqualified from all competitions.
