        <h4>How do TradersBit simulate trades?</h4>
        <p>
          When simulating trades (LONG, SHORT, CLOSE), we use the last price and 0.02% fee (takers fee). Each signal will simulate
          a trade using all assets available.

        <h4>What does LONG, SHORT and CLOSE mean?</h4>
        <p>
          SHORT, LONG, and CLOSE are the signalks you can send to your streams. A SHORT or LONG signal is always followed by a CLOSE
          signal. If you go directly from SHORT to LONG or LONG to SHORT, a CLOSE signal is automatically generated for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you send a LONG signal, you will make a profit if the price of the Bitcoin goes up. You profit if the price of the Bitcoin
          is higher when you CLOSE your trade than it was when you sent the LONG signal. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp"

        </p>
        <p>
          If you send a SHORT signal, you will make a profit if the price of the Bitcoin goes down. You profit if the price of the
          Bitcoin is lower when you CLOSE your trade than it was when you sent the SHORT signal. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp"

        </p>
        <p>
          A CLOSE signal closes your current position.

        <h4>How will TradersBit make money?</h4>
        <p>
          TradersBit gets 30% of the subscription fee when subscribers buy subscriptions to streams. The publisher of the stream gets
          70%. We make money if the publisher makes money.

          Yes, we are planning to host competitions at least until publishers start earning money by selling subscriptions.

        <h4>What does BETA mean?</h4>
        <p>
          TradersBit is currently in BETA. By this, we mean we are in the early stages, under heavy development and TradersBit not
          thoroughly tested yet. Therefore, there might be unforeseen events like parts of the service might not work as
          intended, there might be downtime, and there are not all essential features are implemented yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should not have any impact on who wins the competition because all users should have the same experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We released in BETA because we wanted to release a version as fast as possible to let publisher start building statistics.

        <h4>How many streams can I have?</h4>
        <p>
          For now, each user can have three streams each.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be one account per user. Users with multiple accounts might be banned and disqualified from all competitions.
