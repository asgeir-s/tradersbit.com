        <h6 class="md-title">How does the TradingBots work?</h6>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          A TradingBot will trade the stream's incoming signals, on the subscriber's behalf.
        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          For now, the TradingBots only does margin trading. Therefore, the money you want your TradingBot to trade with must be in
          your "Trading Wallet" at Bitfinex.
        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          All trades executed by TradingBots are market orders. A market order is a buy or a sell order to be executed immediately
          at current market prices. This means that you should not expect to get the exact same price as recorded in the
          trading signal, because of slippage, latency, etc. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp"
            target="_blank">Read about slippage on Investopedia.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          On the first signal, the TradingBot will close any open BTC/USD margin position before executing the signaled order. When
          executing an order, the amount the TradingBot will use to buy or sell short is your specified "Percentage to Trade"
          of "Tradable Balance" in your "Trading Wallet". You can check your "Tradable Balance" by logging into Bitfinex,
          then on the right side panel select "Trading" (in the drop down menu), then you see your "Tradable Balance" under
          "On Pair BTCUSD". If you specified 100% "Percentage to Trade", it will use 99.9%, this is done to make sure you
          have the funds to cover the order at the order time.
        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          There is an average latency of approximately 2 seconds from a signal is published by the publisher, until the order is executed
          at the exchange. Therefore, this should not be thought of as a high-frequency trading solution.
        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          You need a separate Bitfinex account for each TradingBot. This is because of how Bitfinex handles your positions. For instance,
          it is not possible to have a LONG and a SHORT position active at the same time. If you want more then one TradingBot
          running, just open a new Bitfinex account.

        <h6 class="md-title">How do TradersBit simulate trades?</h6>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          When simulating trades (LONG, SHORT, CLOSE), we use the last price and 0.02% fee (takers fee). Each signal will simulate
          a trade using all assets available.

        <h6 class="md-title">What does LONG, SHORT and CLOSE mean?</h6>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          SHORT, LONG, and CLOSE are the signalks you can send to your streams. A SHORT or LONG signal is always followed by a CLOSE
          signal. If you go directly from SHORT to LONG or LONG to SHORT, a CLOSE signal is automatically generated for you.
        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          If you send a LONG signal, you will make a profit if the price of the Bitcoin goes up. You profit if the price of the Bitcoin
          is higher when you CLOSE your trade than it was when you sent the LONG signal. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp"

        </p>
        <p class="md-body-1">
          If you send a SHORT signal, you will make a profit if the price of the Bitcoin goes down. You profit if the price of the
          Bitcoin is lower when you CLOSE your trade than it was when you sent the SHORT signal. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp"
